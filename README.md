# CNC Case for the Ploopy Knob

![Finished CNC Ploopy Knob Case](https://github.com/tuxedocurly/Ploopy-Knob-CNC-Case/blob/main/images/Finished%20knob%20plugged%20in.jpg)


A premium, CNC-machined case for the open-source [Ploopy Knob](https://github.com/ploopyco/knob). This project provides the design files and instructions needed to machine your own high-quality case, giving the already-great Ploopy Knob a satisfying, natural, premium finish.

> [!TIP]
> **Want one but don't have a CNC and 3D printer?**
> No problem! You can purchase a lovingly machined and finished version of this case directly from my shop.

## About The Project

The Ploopy Knob is a fantastic open-source rotary input device. I love its functionality and hackability, but as a maker, I wanted to create an enclosure that was as wonderful to look at as the device is to use.

This custom case is machined from a solid block of maple. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for the original 3D-printed case, utilizing the same Ploopy Knob PCB, bearing, and screws.

## How to Make Your Own

This section is for those who have access to a CNC mill and 3D printer and want to create their own case.

## 3D Printing

To keep the bearing and magnets in place in the case, you'll need some 3D printed parts.

1.  **Print the Parts:** Grab the 3D print files provided in this repo and print them out. PLA works just fine here, but PETG or ABS would also be perfectly suitable.

## Machining & Finishing

Machining this part is a reasonably straightforward process. The primary challenge is to make sure you choose the right bits for the job to avoid tearout in the wood, particularly while machine the thin edge profiles and small details.

1.  **Stock:** Start with a piece of stock (I used wood) slightly thicker than your part.
2.  **CAM Setup:** Import the SVG or DWG into your CAM program of choice.
3.  **Operation 1 (Top Side) Steps will vary depending in your setup and preference, but generally you'll want to:**
    * Face the top of the stock.
    * Machine the outer profile.
    * Machine the main internal pocket for the PCB.
    * Machine the profile for the bearing.
    * Drill the holes for the bottom plate screws.
6.  **Finishing:**
    * **Sand:** Carefully sand all surfaces and remove any stray fibers that will otherwise interfere with the fitment.
    * **USB C Cutout:** There are many ways to do this, but a simple, albeit manual, method is to drill a hole into the face where the USB C port will be located, then use a small round file or rotary tool to carefully match the profile of the usb C port. Insert the pcb into the bottom case to check the fit as you go.

## Assembly Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Case:** Ensure your machined case is clean and free of any chips or burrs. Be sure to pre-drill the holes for the mounting screws. If using wood, this keeps the case from splitting. Other material types (such as aluminum) may require taps and replacement machine screws to match your chosen hardware.
2.  **(Optional) For Wood Cases: Seal the wood with your favorite finish -** Most any finish will do well here. Hard wax oils are easy to apply and turn out great. DO NOT apply finish to the areas of the top case where the 3D printed bearing retainer brackets and magnet holder go. It may compromise the bond between the wood and the glue you'll need to fix these in place.
3.  **3D Printed Parts:** Carefully glue the 3 bearing retainer brackets and center magnet holder into place. I found a thin superglue worked well for this application with PLA. Note that glue is not required, but the components may fall out if you jostle the knob or disassemble it. I recommend glue once you've done a test fit, but you do you.
4.  **Install the PCB:** Carefully place the main Ploopy Knob PCB into the machined pocket on the bottom case. It should be a snug fit. Screw that bad boy in. This is it's home now.
5.  **Transplant the Bearings and Magnets:** Press the bearing into the top case. The fit will be snug. Move your magents over to the magent holder on the top case.
6.  **Put It All Together:** If desired, place some non-slip feet on the base of the bottom case. If using stick on rubber feet, I recommend using 3. On the version I sell, I use cork to match the aesthetic of the wood enclosure and it does a nice job keeping the knob from slipping. Press the top and bottom halves of the case together carefully.
7.  **Done!** Play with your knob. You earned it.
