The files for the 3D printed parts. You'll need:
- 3x bearing retainer bracket
- 1x magnet mount

If you're using a spray finish on a wooden knob, you'll probably want to ensure overspray doesn't get onto the areas where the magnet holder and bearing retainer brackets will later be glued into place to ensure proper glue adhesion. You can print x3 of the retainer bracket plugs and 1x center magnet holder and put those into place while finishing. I found this to be much faster than trying to tape off the areas manually.
